						  	<h6 align="center"><b>OnLegacy Network Agreement with <br>IBO’s Regarding Smart Mark Products</b></h6>

						  	<p style="text-align: justify">Distributors of OnLegacy Network, LLC also known as Independent Business Owners (IBO’s) will promote and sell Smart Mark telecommunication goods and services as part of their buffet of products available to end consumers also known as participants. Among those products is a license to sell installation kits that will register new phone line rate plans that include a minimal start up fee through the purchase of such kit, and a one-time operations fee to get started. The benefits to end participants include a subsidized monthly cellular rate plan for a determined period of time. OnLegacy Network, LLC will NOT be liable for any product or service provided by Smart Mark.</p>



						  	<p style="text-align: justify">It is important for OnLegacy Network, LLC to have its army of IBO’s properly trained as to the correct marketing, terminologies, definitions and ethical understandings moving forward. </p>



						  	<p style="text-align: justify"><u>I. Proper Use of Terminologies</u> </p>



						  	<p style="text-align: justify">OnLegacy Network IBO’s will abstain from using terminologies that are strictly prohibited at sales meetings, one-on-ones, through social media, by any personal marketing efforts or otherwise. Words that will not be mentioned are: </p>



						  	<ol>

							  <li>Sim Cards</li>

							  <li>AT&T</li>

							  <li>Free Services</li>

							  <li>Activation Fee</li>

							  <li>Client</li>

							  <li>Retail Store</li>

							</ol> 



							<p style="text-align: justify">In order to convey a rightful understanding, OnLegacy IBOs will use: </p>



							<ol>

							  <li>Installation Kit (instead of Sim Cards)</li>

							  <li>Largest 4G GSM Network (instead of AT&T)</li>

							  <li>Subsidized Services (instead of Free Services)</li>

							  <li>Operating Costs (instead of Activation Fee)</li>

							  <li>Participant (instead of client)</li>

							  <li>Installation Location (instead of Retail Store)</li>

							</ol> 



							<p style="text-align: justify">Failure to properly convey these terminologies may result in the suspension and/or cancellation of the IBO’s contract indefinitely.</p>



							<p style="text-align: justify"><u>II. Definitions</u> </p>

							<p style="text-align: justify">As pertains to this contract:</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify">Founder IBO - an OnLegacy Network member that joined the company during its foundation phase period. Only Founders can register new statewide wireless Installation Locations that already exist and offer the product for sale to end consumers. </p>



							<p style="text-align: justify">Sales IBO - an OnLegacy Network member that joins the company after the foundation phase is over, also known as the official pre-launch phase. </p>





							<p style="text-align: justify">Installation Location - a legal entity with a) a physical storefront (ex: store in a strip mall, kiosk in a mall, desk inside a grocery store); b) a legal retail sales license; c) a signed contract with SmartMark but channeled through OnLegacy Network, LLC. </p>



							<p style="text-align: justify">Regional IBO - a high-ranking OnLegacy distributor who meets the Installation Location criteria with an active and in good standing account, who has passed a questionnaire, who has purchased in advance a minimum of 1,000 installation kits at $23 per kit, and who purchases a minimum of 250 installation kits each month. (Regional IBO must register at least 35% of purchased installation kits before acquiring more.) </p>



							<p style="text-align: justify">In case a Regional IBOdoes not meet the criteria for two consecutive months, it will lose the Regional IBO benefits and will go back to an Installation Location Status losing thereby their residual income as a Regional IBO. </p>



							<p style="text-align: justify"><u>III. Costs and Earnings</u> </p>



							<p style="text-align: justify">The use of Smart Mark’s technologies will cost: </p>



							<ol>

							  <li>An Installation Location: $25 per kit + $10 one-time Operations Fee</li>

							  <li>An OnLegacy Sales or Founder IBO: $50 per kit + a $15 one-time Operations Fee</li>

							  <li>An OnLegacy Regional IBO: $23 per kit + a $10 one-time Operations Fee</li>

							 

							</ol> 



							<p style="text-align: justify">Installation Locations earn $5 per month per each line that remains active (such residual will be paid directly from SmartMark and OnLegacy Network, LLC and its affiliates will not be liable for any delay, cancellation, or any change by SmartMark on this payment). First residual commission will be payable up to 60 days after the original registration. Installation Location kit suggested retail price is $125. If such kit is sold for less than $99, account holder may be terminated. Max $149. </p>





							<p style="text-align: justify">Regional IBO earns .50 cents override monthly residual of every line that remains active coming from its directly sponsored Installation Locations. First residual commission will be payable up to 75 days after the original registration (such residual will be paid directly by OnLegacy Network, LLC,; however OnLegacy Network, LLC and its affiliates will NOT be liable for any delay, cancellation, and/or any changes made by SmartMark on this payment).</p>



							<p style="text-align: justify">Only OnLegacy Founder IBO’s can register Location Installations, but will not earn the .50 cents override. If an OnLegacy Network Founder IBO sponsors another Founder IBO during the company’s prelaunch phase, it will earn .50 cents per kit sold, which is not a residual payment since it is a per kit sale commission. .50 cents will be paid 4 levels deep on uni-level of Onlegacy Network Team.</p>



							<p style="text-align: justify">If a Sales IBO who is not a Founder IBO signs up an Installation Location, it needs to find a Founder in it’s upline who will sign up the Installation Location, and it will earn half (50%) of the Founder IBO’s earnings on that particular Installation Location’s sales.</p>





							<p style="text-align: justify"><u>IV. Ethics</u> </p>

							<p style="text-align: justify">OnLegacy Network IBO’s may not:</p>



							<ol>

							  <li>Post any form of advertising or marketing through the Internet, social media, or print advertisement without OnLegacy Network’s consent and Smart Mark’s approval. All advertising or marketing efforts must be first sent to: compliance@onlegacynetwork.com in order to receive such approval. One warning will be given. After that, the account will be terminated.</li>

							  <li>Resell Smart Mark products or services on Ebay, Amazon, AliBaba, or other websites.</li>

							  

							</ol> 



							<p style="text-align: justify">Installation Location owners may not:</p>



							<ol>

							  <li>Sell to OnLegacy IBO’s. </li>

							  <li>Resell Smart Mark products or services on Ebay, Amazon, AliBaba, or other websites</li>

							  <li>Sell outside their geographical locations (ex: a store in Los Angeles sells in San Jose).</li>

							  

							</ol> 



							<p style="text-align: justify">Regional IBO’s may not:</p>



							<ol>

							  <li>Sell to OnLegacy IBOs </li>

							  <li>Resell Smart Mark products or services on Ebay, Amazon, AliBaba, or other websites</li>

							  

							</ol> 



							<p style="text-align: justify">Cancellation of accounts will result in the automatic loss of residual income. </p>



							<p style="text-align: justify"><u>V. Miscellaneous</u> </p>



							<p style="text-align: justify">OnLegacy Network encourages their IBO’s to open their own Installation Locations.  </p>



						



							<p style="text-align: justify">Smart Mark customer services will be available to Installation Location owners and participants. However, OnLegacy IBOs will have the use of OnLegacy’s customer service to help their participants with their telecommunication and rate plan questions and needs.  </p>





							<p style="text-align: justify">By signing this agreement, the OnLegacy Network IBO expresses it has read, understood and agrees to the terms expressed in this agreement. </p>
